<h1>School Library Media</h1>
	<p>The school library media program is selected by students who wish to work with young people in school libraries of public and private K-12 institutions. The Catholic University of America program is recognized by the states of Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia. This course of study is offered both as part of our Online & Weekend Learning (OWL) program and in traditional face to face format.</p>
	<p>The course of study listed below has program accreditation by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) and by the American Library Association (ALA).</p>
	<p>The CUA Library and Information Science program offers a variety of courses that focus on school library media services. Each student is required to take the four required core courses along with appropriate mid-level and advanced courses.</p>
	<p>Note that very specific requirements must be fulfilled in order to receive the state-issued certificate, which is required to work in public school libraries. Because of this, it is vitally important that students pursuing this program of study stay in close contact with their advisor to ensure that their course work will fulfill state requirements. Students who lack valid teaching certificates should be aware that there is a high probability that they will be required to take some education courses, in addition to the courses listed below, to qualify for certification as a school media specialist.</p>
