<h1>Law Librarianship</h1>
<p>A specialization in Law Librarianship is the gateway to a wide variety of interesting, exciting, and challenging professional opportunities. Some law librarians work in fast-paced law firms, ensuring that the attorneys have all the relevant legal and business information bearing on high-stakes cases they're litigating. Others work in federal, state, and local courts, providing the judges and their clerks with the background information they need to administer justice in the traditions of our nation. Others find their professional home in academe, taking on the responsibility for the organization and operation of libraries serving professors and law students as they research, study, and write about the law. No matter which path they choose, law librarians share in a stimulating and rewarding profession.</p>
	<p>At the Catholic University of America, our Law librarianship program combines an emphasis on legal information sources and services and law library management with a general preparation for professional librarianship. Each student will take the four required core courses in the Master's degree program, required courses for the Law Librarianship specialization, and other appropriate mid-level and advanced courses. It is also strongly recommended that the student obtain professional-level experience through a combination of regular employment, internships, or a practicum. The student will consult with the law librarianship advisor to plan a course of study that will best meet the student's personal and professional needs.</p>

<h3>Joint J.D. (Law) - M.S.L.S. Program:</h3>
<p>Some law librarians hold degrees in both Law and Library Science. While not necessary for many positions in law libraries, a law degree is frequently required for management positions in academic and research institutions. To support students interested in combining the two disciplines, Library and Information Science and the Columbus School of Law offer a joint-degree program to provide academic preparation for law librarianship. The total number of library and information science semester hours of graduate credit required is reduced to 27, and a student in the program may apply up to 12 library science credits toward the J.D. degree.</p>

<h4>Notes for Students With a J.D. or Other Advanced Degree</h4>

<h5>Previous Graduate Degree Exemption</h5>
<p>A student who holds one or more accredited graduate degrees when admitted to the program will be automatically exempt from six semester credit hours; however, all remaining credits must be earned within Library and Information Science. To request this exemption, an official transcript of the graduate degree must be submitted at the time application is made.</p>

<h5>Exemption from LSC 830, Legal Literature, for Students with the J.D.</h5>
<p>Students with the J.D. degree, who have taken a course in legal research, may petition to enroll in LSC 839, Advanced Legal Research, without taking the prerequisite LSC 830, Legal Literature.</p>
