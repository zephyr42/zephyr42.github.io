<h1>Health Sciences</h1>
	<p>Concerns over the provision and quality of health care and strong interest in health care resources and research suggest a strong market need for information professionals who are specialize in health sciences resources and health care. The purpose of this course of study is to produce information professionals who are knowledgeable about health sciences resources and the organization, retrieval, and management of such resources to meet the needs of clinicians, researchers, nurses, other health care professionals, decision makers, policy developers and the public. Students who complete this course of study will have the competencies to work as health information professionals in the following information environments:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Hospital libraries</li>
	<li>Public libraries</li>
	<li>Special libraries, such as pharmaceutical libraries, corporate libraries, and federal libraries.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Student who pursue this course of study may be qualified to apply for positions such as:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Health information specialists</li>
	<li>Medical librarians</li>
	<li>Medical records specialists</li>
	<li>Health Informationists</li>
	<li>Medical Informatics</li>
</ul> 
<h2>Competencies</h2>
	<p>This course of study is designed to foster the development of professional competencies in the six areas identified by LIS (see The Professional Competencies for Graduates of the Masters in Library Science Degree Program http://lis.cua.edu/about/Accreditation/documents/SLISCompetenciesAdopted20080326.pdf ). Specifically, this document aims to help students develop competency in the five areas listed below. These competencies are closely aligned with the recommendations of the Medical Library Association’s “Competencies for Lifelong Learning and Professional Success: The Educational Policy Statement of the Medical Library Association” (2007).</p>
<ol>
	<li>Knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA) related to health sciences information resources and information systems. The KSA covers competencies in professional ethics, information organization, services, and resources.</li>
	<li>Knowledge of the health sciences, the health care environment, and the policies, legislation, issues, and trends that affect the health care environment.</li>
	<li>Health information technologies, including database management, usability testing, knowledge of user behaviors and commitment to user-centered design of information systems, such as systems for personal health records and electronic medical records.</li>
	<li>Research, including knowledge of research methodologies and statistics, and ability to conduct research and present research effectively.</li>
	<li>Leadership and management, including the ability to promote collaboration, participate effectively in collaborative projects, and manage projects successfully.</li>
</ol>
