<h1>Cultural Heritage Information Management (CHIM)</h1>
	<p>The Cultural Heritage Information Management (CHIM) course of study is designed to educate cultural heritage information professionals for the 21st century and prepare students for careers in cultural institutions such as libraries, archives, and museums. The CHIM course of study is designed to address the market needs created by the convergence of practice in libraries, archives, and museums. Libraries, Archives, and Museums (LAM) have a huge wealth of cultural heritage resources of great importance to their communities. These institutions face the challenge of preserving such resources for future generations as well as making use of digital technology to allow patrons greater access to their collections. Thus, the CHIM course of study is a unique program to ensure that students acquire the knowledge and skills needed to help cultural heritage institutions address challenges posed by the evolving information environment.</p>

	<p>The CUA Department of Library and Information Science offers a variety of courses that focus on CHIM. Each student will take the four required core courses, plus highly recommended specialized courses for CHIM. The student will consult with his/her advisor to plan a course of study that will best meet the student's personal and professional needs.</p>

		<p>For experiential learning, students have the option of undertaking 120 hours of highly structured practicum under the supervision of professionals at partner institutions including Art Museum of the Americas, Corcoran School of Art and Design, Library of Congress, National Agricultural Library, National Library of Medicine, and the Smithsonian Institution. Students can work on projects such as resource management, digital content creation, preservation, and service delivery.</p>

<p>Full-time faculty: Dr. Young Choi, Dr. Ingrid Hsieh-Yee, Dr. Jane Zhang</p>
<p>Part-time faculty: Mary Elings, Maria Mazzenga, Sally Stokes</p>
