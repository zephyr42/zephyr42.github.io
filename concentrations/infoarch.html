<h1>Information Architecture</h1>
	<p>Information architects develop and apply classification systems and database schemas, business processes and workflows to manage complex data sets and information resources. Their work often involves researching, acquiring and integrating diverse datasets. They design and evaluate information environments that are as varied as shopping sites, web portals, databases, search engines and directories, online financial services, social media sites, online communities and mobile (PDA) applications.</p>
<p>An information architect's responsibilities can include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Collaborating with management, clients, end users, programmers and other IT personnel to balance the needs of the sponsoring organization and the needs of its audiences.</li>
	<li>Determining what content the resource will contain and functionality it will support.</li>
	<li>Specifying how users will find information in the resource by defining its organization, navigation, labeling, and searching systems.</li>
	<li>Evaluating the design and usability of information resources and environments.</li>
	<li>Researching and applying relevant standards.</li>
	<li>Defining strategies for how the resource will accommodate change and growth over time.</li>
	<li>Documenting information designs using site maps, wireframes, blueprints, controlled vocabularies, metadata schema, and other techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Adapted from Rosenfeld and Morville, 1998, 2002; and Morrogh, 2003)</p>
<p>Information architecture draws on many fields, including library science, computer science, social informatics, information design, visual design, and engineering psychology (Morrogh, 2003, p. 5). The IA course of study reflects this diversity. The CUA Library and Information Science offers a variety of courses that focus on information architecture. Each student will take the four required core courses, plus highly recommended specialized courses for IA. The student will consult with his/her advisor to plan a course of study that will best meet the student's personal and professional needs.</p>
